## Devlog
Unity's structure is almost like an ecosystem. The organs inside the animals are like components. They allows a Game Object to perform particular tasks like seeing, moving, and interacting. Organs cooperate and work together to power the animal, just like components work together to create game objects. Last but not least, scenes are the settings or habitats in which these animals live together.

When I was creating my level, I observed that altering a single component, such as movement speed, altered the behavior of the entire GameObject in the scene. It made it easier for me to understand how the enviroment, animals, and their organs all work together to create a playable universe.
